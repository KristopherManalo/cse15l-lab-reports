4. Open a Terminal in VS Code
5. Make sure that the terminal is using [bash](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal/50527994#50527994) instead of powershell

## Remote Connection to CSE Computer (SSH)

The following can only be done from a terminal set up to use bash.
In the terminal type the command
```$ ssh cs15lwi23[specific user code]@ieng6.ucsd.edu```
For the student Kristoher Manalo, the specific user code is ```aud```

Once connected, you should see something like

## Testing Some Commands

The connected environment is a very standard linux machine.
So a variety of standard bash commands can be used.
These commands include but are not limited to:
* cd
* ls
* cp
* cat
* etc.

The following image shows a student testing commands in the linux environment that they ssh'd into.
