# Lab Report 5 - Lab Report 4 REDUX
## Automization
The solution to make it more streamline is to use a bash script.
Pros:
- All commands will run from in order from a single execution
- Faster
Cons:
- Much more setup time
- Slightly more annoying to edit
    - For example, if there is an error in the bash script, would require to open the file and find the line where the error is happening rather then just modifying the command that errored at command line.
## The original steps
1. Log onto ieng6
2. Clone the fork onto ieng6
3. Run the tests
4. Correct the code
5. Running the tests with corrected code
6. Uploading to GitHub
