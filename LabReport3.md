William Randolph Hearst (1863–1951) was a millionaire newspaper baron. He began building this grandiose retreat in 1919 on a ranch that he had inherited from his father, who made his fortune mining Nevada’s Comstock Lode. It was still not completed by the time of Hearst’s death in 1951. Here he entertained the movie star `red:`Marion Davies, his mistress for 30 years, and famous guests such as Charlie Chaplin, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Greta Garbo, Winston Churchill, Charles Lindbergh, and the photographer Herman Mankiewicz, who recorded life at San Simeon for posterity.
