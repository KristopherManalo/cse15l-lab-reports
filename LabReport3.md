written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/China-WhatToDo.txt:Popular with adults and children, the Chinese shadow play (a 2,000-year-old art form) dramatizes familiar legends. The two-dimensional puppets, manipulated behind a silk screen, can jump and fly, giving the colorful silhouettes an advantage over the actors in Chinese opera. The busy puppeteers give voice to their characters, often in song. Professional and amateur shadow-play troupes also put on shows with marionettes.

written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Kauffman/ch9.txt:All goes well until all the screws are used up. The seat, having relied on screws and screwdrivers to attach padding, goes nuts and looks about frantically, asking the screwdriver to work on nails. No luck. Eventually, the seat tries nails and hammers jointly, and that complementary pair works. More chairs are constructed, then nails run out and failures propagate throughout the system.

written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-WhatToDo.txt:Edibles: Wonderful foods from the Greek countryside include honey, olives and olive oil, and nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts. All can be bought in pretty packaging for you to take home. For something a little stronger try ouzo — the aniseed flavor aperitif — or Greek brandy, which is slightly sweeter than French Cognac. Metaxa is the most famous brand name.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Athens-WhereToGo.txt:This is the closest island to the mainland and the pretty quayside of Aegina Town, with its Neo-Classical buildings, awaits as you disembark. You’ll see a pretty whitewashed church protecting the harbor entrance. Stroll along the water’s edge past the colorful fishing fleet, have lunch at a seafront taverna, or buy some of the pistachio nuts or local ceramics for which the island is famed. The resort of Agia Marina is 15 km (9 miles) from the town on the west coast and has a good child-friendly beach, and most people make a trip to the nearby fifth century b.c. Temple of Aphaia for some more history.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Crete-WhatToDo.txt:Honey is also one of the prime staples of the Cretan diet. Wild herbs and flowers on the hills impart a wonderful flavor, and you can buy it plain or with nuts added.
written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/Nepal-WhereToGo.txt:Bhaktapur expanded over the centuries from a nucleus around the Tachupal Tole, reached by a walk from the Nyatapola Temple through narrow streets full of unfamiliar merchandise: the lengths of red yarn are sold to be plaited in women’s hair; the gray cannonballs are homemade soap, the conical yellowish cigarettes are bidi, the cheapest tobacco, and can be bought singly. There will be heaps of orange turmeric, cardamom, ginger, and other spices, and bundles of dried fish, looking like twigs. Pan sellers offer to mix lime, spices, and bits of nuts and tobacco in a fresh betel-leaf packet for chewing. Bigger leaves stuck together with bamboo toothpicks are sold as plates for temple offerings.
